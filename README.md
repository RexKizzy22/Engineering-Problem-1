# Engineering Problems

This repo contains problems one should be able to solve in a reasonable amount of time.
It tests one's understanding of JavaScript fundamentals.


## How to Run
You can run the test cases by running

```bash
yarn
yarn jest --watch
```

Or if you use npm

```bash
npm install
npm test -- --watch
```

You can elide the `--watch` flag to just run tests

If all tests pass, you have successfully solved the questions.

The solution to question 1 can be found in `src/classifier.js`
The solution to question 2 can be found in `src/laundry.js`
