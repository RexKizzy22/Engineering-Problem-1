# Engineering Problems

This repo contains problems you should be able to solve in a reasonable amount of time (5 days).
It tests your understanding of programming fundamentals.

- [Classifier](classifier.md)
- [Laundry](laundry.md)


## How to Run

You can run the test cases by running

```bash
yarn
yarn jest --watch
```

Or if you use npm

```bash
npm install
npm test -- --watch
```

You can elide the `--watch` flag to just run tests

If all tests pass, you have successfully solved the questions.

The solution to the classifier problem should go in `src/classifier.js`
The solution to the laundry problem should go in `src/laundry.js`
